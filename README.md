## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
Resume Review: Implement an AI-driven resume review system where users (selectors)
 can score resumes based on a variety of criteria like qualifications, keywords, or work
 experience.
 Interview Simulation: Use a chat-based or video-based interview system where the
 applicant responds to predefined questions, and the selector can score the answers.
 Mock Interviews for Applicants: Applicants can simulate interviews and receive feedback
 on their responses (e.g., how well they handle stress, how clear their answers are).
 main
 Virtual Job Fair: Simulate job fairs where applicants can interact with selectors in a mock
 environment, practicing their networking and interviewing skills
Allow applicants to submit their resumes and cover letters through the platform.
 Simulate real-world job posting and application processes with features for uploading
 resumes and attaching documents. You could implement an AI-driven resume parser to
 extract key details (e.g., qualifications, experience).
 Automated Screening Tools: Implement resume scoring based on criteria defined in the
 job description (e.g., education, experience, skills). AI could score and rank applicants
 automatically based on keyword matching or predefined skills.
 Manual Screening Simulation: Allow selectors to manually review resumes, rate
 candidates based on specific criteria, and flag interesting applicants. Provide a space for
 notes and comments

## Technology Stack


Frontend: React.js, Vue.js, or Angular for building interactive and dynamic user
 interfaces.
 Backend: Node.js, Django, or Flask to handle simulations, user management, and
 analytics.
 AI/ML: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, or GPT-4 to implement machine learning models for
 resume analysis, feedback generation, and bias detection.
 Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user profiles, applicants, and simulation
 results.
 Cloud: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for scalable deployment.
